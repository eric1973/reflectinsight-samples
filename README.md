ReflectInsight Samples
===============

The majority of these samples are in .NET Framework 4.0. Only specific samples like the Enterprise Library Logging Application Block v6 
and Semantic Logging samples are in .NET Framework 4.5, as they require that version of the framework to run.

Most of the samples include a README.txt file, which explains in more detail about the sample and the concepts being demonstrated.

All of the samples use NuGet Packages, so you will need to install NuGet if you haven't already done so.

To test a particular sample, you will need to right click the sample and select "Set as Startup Project".

New samples, and especially improvements to existing samples, are always welcome.
