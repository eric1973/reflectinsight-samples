BEFORE YOU START, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS

1. Create a Sql Database (i.e. ReflectInsigh.Log)
2. Run the "Database.Creation.sql" included in the Listener project

That's it.

Review the Sample.config file to see what options are available for which message properties you like to log. By default, all message properties are logged. 

Thanks for using ReflectInsight.
