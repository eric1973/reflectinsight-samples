Headless Configuration Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use ReflectInsight with headless configuration in your application. Headless configuration means you don't need to update your app/web configuration with
references to the insightSettings congfiguration and you can load the configuration at runtime from a remote file.

1. In this sample you will notice there is no application configuratoin file.

2. There are 2 satellite configuration files, ReflectInsight.congfig and then ReflectInsight2.config located in the "Other Config" sub-folder.

3. Look at the source code in program.cs at how to load the configuration file dynamically at runtime.

4. That's it your done!
